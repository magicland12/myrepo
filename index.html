        - Mr. Brighton: Of course Cris! Could you confirm that you exactly would be there on 5 pm without late?</br>
        - Chris: Yes, Mr. Prighton, I confirm! Thank you for being flexible and messing you around. I'll do my best ot get the</br>
        presentation in time.</br>
        - Mr. Brighton: Am....Chris, I'm aftaid but we can't reschedule the demo. I forgot about Mr'Chang who said that their team</br>
